<h2>
<ol>
<li> It is essential to work with the subject matter experts to select the appropriate search tags.</li>
<li> These tags will be used to build on the fly custom search forms for the subject matter. For example, the forms for searching through children's materials must have search boxes that are different from the forms for searching for the Boston marathon.</li> 
<li> One possible extension to the model is creating a collection i.e. table that includes expert commentary on each item.</li>
<li> Another extension is to use the search tags to build virtual communities around enquiry into specific topics such as methods of investigating human rights violations or the history of hate literature.</li>
