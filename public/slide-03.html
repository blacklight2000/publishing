<ol>
<li> deciding how to classify the one copy of a multidisciplnary/multitopic book is a bad trip.</li>
<li> not suitable for any other printed materials such as tracts, pamphlets, magazines, newspapers, etc.</li> 
<li> original documents such as the John Jay papers must be given their own library, complete with custom classification of the docs.</li>
<li> treats multimedia as if it doesn't exist.</li>
<li> has no flexibility, built-in or otherwise, to include technologies/formats not invented as yet.</li>
